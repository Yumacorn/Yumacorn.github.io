Being able to dynamically 'import' your front-end functionality at different points in your front-end is nowhere near understated!

React is one of the easiest and most intuitive ways to manager multiple display Components, features, and appearances for a new an existing app that I've come across, and it's widely used fan-based see the ease in which a new application can be started

For starters, pull up to their website which features a ton of examples, effective instructions and easy "get started" material at [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

1. By running `npx create-react-app my-app` with the **'my-app'** portion being the name of your new app, you can have a new front-end interface up and running within a minute!

2. Once your app finishes installing, `cd` into your new app and run by using `npm start`

3. Here you can begin adjusting the components and display values of the app and see their lives changes appear on your website! 

That was easy! The best part about React is that while it's a low barrier for starting, it seems that there is no end to the apps and creativity developers can bring to the table in exploring new ideas and showcasing new features!
