It is of the utmost importance to have good documentation, which should always strive to be reliable and readable to any incoming user. Not only does this help save yourself a ton of headachces as you can see how you developed a program over time and made conscious deciscions to do or not to a task a certain way, this also allows you to be able to branch off and explore those ideas, without losing sight of a stable build.

For example, I'm sure that most end-users have ideas of stretch goals: features which would be really cool to explore and develop, but might not warrant the time or research at the moment to make it worthwhile. Being able to use Github and the commit history messages, communicate well within a team, and make several pull requests or branch off the main directory is incredible! By leaving key checkpoints of when a feature has been implemented fully, or developed to the point where it can be left in it's current condition is something Git control offers to all of its users.

This is especially true of learning and developing programs. Many walkthroughs, labs, and codealongs all exist - typically of varying complextiy and domain subject matter. I know a couple of labs that I would now love to turn around and use my new found confidence in coding to take a second, even third crack at!

* Commit Early
* Commit Often
* Commit Well

It's the desire to keep things organized and maintain/monitor our progress which helps us show how far we've developed. And in some cases, how much more room we have to continue progressing forwards.

Remember to keep documenting! You never know when you might want to take a peek into the past and bring up a good idea or process in the near future!
