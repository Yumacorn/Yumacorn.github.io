Slowly but surely, I am seeing the abilities of structured coding coming together as lesson after lesson, project after project, begins to take form and shape a beginning programmer into someone who is more confident and capable of taking on new challenges.

You don't begin Coding by attempting to tackle a Facebook-sized undertaking from the get-go.

No. You need practiced diligence and the drive to seek out the next step in your learning. To start off like Amazon with a small vision focused vision and turn it into something greater by building off your own growth. Not in leaps and spurts, but repeated consistency and a strong mentality to see the problems laid out in front of you and relish in the desire to learn more and want to understand what and how to address them.

Working a full-time job and committing to schooling is no easy task. 

I respect all those who have come before me, all those who make this walk with me, and the countless those who will no doubt follow well after I've made my steps.

This project has reminded me the importance of the Coding Community. Realizing that your own coding knowledge sometimes may be insufficient for the task at hand. And no matter how much you may read through documentation and search for keywords to grasp why an error won't seem to react to any of your solutions, there is always a vast and resourceful Community of Coders out there who know exactly what the situation you are facing.

**A Community which wants you to succeed.**

There is no lack of knowledgable, brilliant, and talented individuals who have overcome many challenges to bring themselves to the coding pinnacle they stand on today. But even moreso are the countless others who have struggled and sought out guidance and assistance from their peers.

After many attempts at attempting to build my first Sinatra Project and running into obstacle after obstacle of "development environment" issues and "unfinished Sinatra forms", "migration" issues and "unstoppable Shotgun servers", it was comforting to think that after some amount of poking around the forums and documentation which is so plentiful on the WEB, every answer could be solved by myself alone.

It helped to remind me that not every problem should be addressed as an individual.

Here were many small issues which while solved in the end through trial and error, were great opportunities to reach out to Cohort members or Technical Leads. Things that could have taken minutes to resolve dragged into hours. Learning through explaning and collobration with others became areas of half-understanding and hoping that I had established the solution.

But with all of these moments, the opposite hold true. Troubleshooting and debugging became a great experience, paired programming with fellow students to find out what was designed to work and what didn't work. Scoping out projects before attempting to begin were great brainstorming sessions with experiecnced staff and helped to plan out a strategy of what to build up.

With all of my attempts to find out why my data failed to persist in my User and Movie database tables through ActiveRecord, attempting to troubleshoot through console, creating dummy Objects manually to see where in the coding process Nil classes were being assigned to attributes, I failed to see the connection in why the data failed to save to the appropriate records.

After a night of frustration, I reached out to my cohort for assistance and received helpful tips of what to look into, suggestions of why the records weren't updating appropriately. A great experience, working with others to help solve a common goal which is important to everyone. After a short review, it was found that attr_accessor is not required when working with classes which as inheriting from ActiveRecord. In fact, using attr_accessor had caused my ActiveRecords to dismiss the attributes and fail to save at all to the database.

It's truly better to attempt to find the answers on your own, but reach out for an extra pair of eyes if find you are spending a little longer than you would prefer on an issue. 

Chances are, someone has already been down the same road you have.. or is just around the bend waiting to ask you for your assistance in the next coding dilemma.
