Javascript is the part of WEB Development where you really get to see the interactivity and responsiveness of your learning come together.

Part of the amazing side of technology is how instantaneous our work can come to life and interact with the world! In order for WEB Developers to bring their websites to life and feel great in the hands of a user, it is a key feature to use Javascript and the toolkit it provides to bring to life functions, clickable buttons, and dynamically updating web pages to make for a smooth and enjoyable website!

Here are some key things every aspiring full-stack WEB Developer should keep handy:

* DO experiment! - Learning the in and outs of javascript eventlisteners and function calls will enhance your experience dramatically. As you continue coding, knowing not only *where you created your querySelector* but also *when you created it* is a key point that can be learned through much troubleshooting when a feature isn't working

Use console.log frequently to make sure as you program, you are getting the data/response you expect

By bookmarking and stepping forward consistently, you'll need only find bugs faster, but will understand the flow of your program better than if you were to assume something works because you've handled it in before

* DO reference the documentation! - The world of WEB Development is constantly evolving, and everyone is learning how to do it better! Places like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) should be constantly open on your browser. It's no joke why developers have several tens of tabs open, if not more! 

By flipping between different approaches, looking at Overstackflow and other WEB forums where developers are having similar questions as you are now, you'll become more comfortable with the approach and asking the questions which will help you find your solution faster than if you were to wait for the "right" answer. There are many many approaches to getting the Website to do what you intend, but finding the right fit for you and your user is a learning experience. Embrace it!

* DON'T forget to git commit constantly! - It's always helpful knowing you have a backup in case you introduce a bug and can't find it for whatever reason. That save point isn't just useful in games you know!

* DO console.log your eventlistener events! - Doing so let's you navigate around your element, and confirm how you're going to achieve your next goal. Piece by piece, your app will come to life!

* DO remember to clear your forms after submitting - Because you will be using `e.preventDefault()` or `event.preventDefault()` consistently with your eventListener techniques, some people forget to clear the forms out following submission. This makes for a good user experience because of responsiveness and keeping your WEB app clear of old info

I hope these general tips help, I'll add more specific ones as I continue to learn Javascript!
